# Other-DS-Bootcamp-Projects

This repo contains a collection of mini projects which were completed during a 16-week Data Science bootcamp.

**What does it do?**
</br>The repo essentially consists of a Jupyter notebook and the raw data files.
The code within the Jupyter notebook leverages well-known Python libraries, such as:
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html)

</br>These modules usually come standard, for example, when Python3 is downloaded through [Anaconda distribution](https://anaconda.org/).
If not, please don't forget to install them (e.g. pip install).

**Who is this for?**
</br>Like myself, anyone who is new at data science and machine learning. I'm more than happy to collaborate or if you simply want to use the code as an example or for other learning purposes.

**Last Note**
</br>As mentioned, these projecta were completed as part of a 16-week Data Science bootcamp offered by [HyperionDev](https://www.hyperiondev.com/).
I'm keen to collaborate & exchange ideas about data science & ML. Howeevr, for queries about the bootcamp content & curriculum, please contact HyperionDev directly.
</br>I hope you'll find the code useful.
### Thanks a lot!
